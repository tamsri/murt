# MURT

Multipath Radio Tracer (MURT) is a ray-tracing engine for multipath propagation of radio waves. MURT is a Python package with the ray-tracing core engine implemented in Python C++ Extension. The package also includes utility tools such as the visualizer, path loss calculator, and the scene generator.

---

## Installations

MURT can be installed by pip, however, `numpy` is required before the installation.

! The pip installation only works with Linux and MacOS for the moment.

```shell
pip install murt
```

the development version can be built via the github repository and Make.

```shell
git clone https:/github.com/tamsri/murt
cd murt
make all
```

## Examples

### 1. Call tracing engine.

The core engine reads the triangulated obj files and process the triangles into the engine.

```Python
from murt import Tracer

# Scene File Path in obj
SCENE_FILE_PATH = "scene_file_path.obj"

# Initialize Tracer
my_tracer = Tracer(SCENE_FILE_PATH)
# Set transmitting position
tx_pos = [ 0, 15, 0]
# Set receiving position
rx_pos = [-30, 1.5, 45]

# Return the traced paths
result = my_tracer.trace(tx_pos, rx_pos)
# [(2, [(-19.24, 8.56, 28.86)]),
#  (3, (-28.94, 4.22, 62.39)),
#  (3, (-70.80, 7.04, 15.22))]
```

The result is the list of traced paths. The first position of the tuple indicates types of the paths (1 - direct path, 2 - diffracted path, 3 - reflected path). The second position of the tuple is the detail of the traced paths.

### 2. Calculate Path Loss.

As the possible paths are traced from the engine. the results from the tracer can be used to

```Python
tx_freq = 2.4e9 # 2.4 GHz

scene_permittivity = 5.3 # Concrete's

result = [(2, [(-19.24, 8.56, 28.86)]),
 (3, (-28.94, 4.22, 62.39)),
 (3, (-70.80, 7.04, 15.22))]

losses = my_tracer.get_total_loss(
 tx_pos, rx_pos, result, tx_freq, scene_permittivity)
# {'total_dB': 84.3, 'signals': [[95.50, 1.86e-07], [86.63, 2.91e-07], [89.27, 4.12e-07]]}
```

The tracer calculates the total path loss according to the theoretical propagation models. In this example, the scene material is considered to be concrete.

### 3. Visualizing traced paths.

To visualize the traced path, MURT package provides a window to display the scene and the paths by filling the information of the paths into the window's lines_set.

```Python
from murt import Tracer
from murt.window import Window
SCENE_FILE_PATH = "scene_file_path.obj"

# load window and scene
my_window = Window()
my_window.load_scene(name="scene_name", file_path = SCENE_FILE_PATH)

# result from the previous example.
tx_pos = [ 0, 15, 0]
rx_pos = [-30, 1.5, 45]
result = [(2, [(-19.24, 8.56, 28.86)]),
 (3, (-28.94, 4.22, 62.39)),
 (3, (-70.80, 7.04, 15.22))]

# convert results to visualised paths
my_window.lines_set += Tracer.result_to_lines(result, tx_pos, rx_pos)

# run
my_window.run()
```

The scene can be rotated by click and drag. the result can be shown below.

### 3. Randomly Generate the Scene

MURT also provides an example of application to procedurally generate the scenes for testing the traced paths from the engine. The application can be directly called from murt.apps.

```Python
from murt.apps import randomer

RANDOM_SEED = 5555
a = randomer(RANDOM_SEED)
a.run()
```

The scene can be regenerated by pressing the G button.
