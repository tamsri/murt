# MURT

Multipath Radio Tracer (MURT) is a ray-tracing engine for multipath propagation of radio wave. MURT is a Python package which consits of ray-tracing engine, visualisation, path loss calculator, and the customized OpenAI Gym for machine learning implementations.

---

## Get Started

MURT consists of multiple module. Each module can be called and used separately in the following.

### Ray Tracing Core

The core engine only accepts the triangulated obj files to the tracing process.

```Python
from murt import tracer

# Scene File Path in obj
SCENE_FILE_PATH =  "scene_file_path.obj"

# Initialize Tracer
my_tracer = tracer(SCENE_FILE_PATH)
# Set transmitting position
tx_pos = [ 0, 15, 0]
# Set receiving position
rx_pos = [-30, 1.5, 45]

# Return the traced paths
result = my_tracer.trace(tx_pos, rx_pos)
# [(2, [(-19.24, 8.56, 28.86)]), (3, (-28.94, 4.22, 62.39)), (3, (-70.80, 7.04, 15.22))]
```

The result is the list of traced paths. The first position of the tuple indicates types of the paths (1 - direct path, 2 - diffracted path, 3 - reflected path). Tbe second position of the tuple is the detail of the traced paths.

### Calculate Path Loss

As the possible paths are traced from the engine. the results from the tracer can be used to

```Python
tx_freq = 2.4e9 # 2.4 GHz

scene_permittivity = 5.3  # Concrete's

result = [(2, [(-19.24, 8.56, 28.86)]),
          (3, (-28.94, 4.22, 62.39)),
          (3, (-70.80, 7.04, 15.22))]

losses = my_tracer.TotalPathLoss(
    tx_pos, rx_pos, result, tx_freq, scene_permittivity)
# {'total_dB': 84.3, 'signals': [[95.50, 1.86e-07], [86.63, 2.91e-07], [89.27, 4.12e-07]]}
```

The tracer calculates the total path loss according to the theoretical propagation models. In this example, the scene material is considered to be concrete.

### Visualization

To visualise the traced path, MURT package provides a window to display the scene and the paths by filling the information of the paths into the window's lines_set.

```Python
from murt import mwindow, tracer
SCENE_FILE_PATH =  "scene_file_path.obj"

# load window and scene
my_window = mwindow()
my_window.load_scene(SCENE_FILE_PATH)

# result from the previous example.
tx_pos = [ 0, 15, 0]
rx_pos = [-30, 1.5, 45]
result = [(2, [(-19.24, 8.56, 28.86)]),
          (3, (-28.94, 4.22, 62.39)),
          (3, (-70.80, 7.04, 15.22))]

# convert results to visualised paths
my_window.lines_set += tracer.result_to_lines(result, tx_pos, rx_pos)

# run
my_window.run()
```

The scene can be rotate by click and drag. the result can be shown below.

#### Procedurally Generated Scene

MURT also provides procedurally generated scenes for testing the multipath propagation. The application can be directly called from murt.apps.

```Python
from murt.apps import randomer

RANDOM_SEED = 5555
a = randomer(RANDOM_SEED)
a.run()
```

The scene can be regenerated by pressed G button.
